This is our final year project, and it includes all the trending technologies like AI and Deep Learning.
For 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-year students, this can be a great reference model to showcase in your college and score full marks.

## 📄 Research Paper

We have also published a research paper based on an earlier version of this project — feel free to check it out for reference.  
Since then, we've made significant improvements to the model.
